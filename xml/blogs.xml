			Recently I have faced a somewhat illogical problem with my newly purchased Dlink
			DIR 600L wireless router. It was that I can not access some websites with this router. At
			first I thought I got some issues with my dns settings then found out it was all ok next I
			went for host configuration and it was also ok, then the problem was definitely with my
			router but every configuration in that was very very ok. I wasted much time thinking about
			that then I thought it was the ISP who is creating the problem and I went to my friends
			home and set it up still the problem was on. Now it is definitely with the router and yes
			it was very easy fix. As PPPoE by default use the MTU of 1492, I just changed it to 1400
			and everything got OK. If you do not know where to change, login to router admin panel by
			going to url 192.168.0.1, give user name and password. go to advanced settings. Now go to
			SETUP tab and then Internet Connection and under the PPPOE find MTU and change it to 1400.
